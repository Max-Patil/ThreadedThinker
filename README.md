# Acknowledgement
* Bluefever Software's YouTube Series( Albert Richard ) - This series really helped me to build chess engine from scratch and it also inspired others to build their own chess engine.
* Chess Programming Wiki - It is extensive resource to become familiar with chess programming concepts in detail. 
* Chess Algorithm Book( Noah Caplinger ) - The author has thoroughly explained algorithms and offered practical insight. 
* Chess Programming Archive ( Bruemore Land ) - This archive also helped me to understand and implement core concepts.
